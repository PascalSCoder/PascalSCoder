- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pascal Spijkstra, software engineering student at 42 network, based at Codam, the campus in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about pathfinding algorithms, physics, embedded programming and procedural generation.
- ðŸ‘€ My favorite projects so far are:
  - Webserver from scratch (https://github.com/Ryno95/webserv) 
  - Raytracing from scratch (https://github.com/PascalSCoder/miniRT) keep in mind this was my first 'real' project.
