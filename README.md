- 👋 Hi, I’m Pascal Spijkstra (a.k.a. @PascalSCoder)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in different fields, like mobile apps, API's, servers, games and in the future a trading bot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about C++, algorithms, physics and the almighty Unreal Engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an Unreal Engine (3d game) project and a trading bot (preferably ml bot, on stocks or crypto).
- 📫 Feel free to reach out if you want to team up: pascalspijkstra@gmail.com
