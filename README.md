- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pascal Spijkstra, software engineering student at 42 network, based at Codam, the campus in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about pathfinding algorithms, physics, embedded programming and procedural generation.
- ðŸ‘€ My favorite projects so far are:
  - [Webserv](https://github.com/Ryno95/webserv), a webserver written in C++ 
  - [MiniRT](https://github.com/PascalSCoder/miniRT), raytracing in C. Keep in mind this was my first 'real' project.
  - [Minishell](https://github.com/PascalSCoder/minishell), a small replica of Bash, written in C
